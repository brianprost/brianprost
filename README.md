A wise elder once told me:

"🚨📢 With this statement, I give notice to Facebook: it's strictly forbidden to disclose 🚫, copy 📄, distribute 🌐, or take any other action against me based on this profile and/or its contents.
NOTE: Facebook is now a public entity. All members must post a note like this. If you prefer, you can copy and paste this version. If you don't publish a statement at least once, it's practically giving a green light to the use of your photos 📸 and the info in your status updates. DO NOT SHARE. Copy and paste. 🔄�"�‍♂️
